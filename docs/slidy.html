<div id="namespaces" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Namespaces</h1>
<p>Docker takes advantage of a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace we call the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.</p>
<p>This provides a layer of isolation: each aspect of a container runs in its own namespace and does not have access outside it.</p>
<p>Some of the namespaces that Docker Engine uses on Linux are:</p>
<p>The pid namespace: Process isolation (PID: Process ID). The net namespace: Managing network interfaces (NET: Networking). The ipc namespace: Managing access to IPC resources (IPC: InterProcess Communication). The mnt namespace: Managing mount-points (MNT: Mount). The uts namespace: Isolating kernel and version identifiers. (UTS: Unix Timesharing System).</p>

<div id="control-groups" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Control groups</h1>
<p>Docker Engine on Linux also makes use of another technology called cgroups or control groups. A key to running applications in isolation is to have them only use the resources you want. This ensures containers are good multi-tenant citizens on a host. Control groups allow Docker Engine to share available hardware resources to containers and, if required, set up limits and constraints. For example, limiting the memory available to a specific container.</p>

<div id="union-file-systems" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Union file systems</h1>
<p>Union file systems, or UnionFS, are file systems that operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker Engine uses union file systems to provide the building blocks for containers. Docker Engine can make use of several union file system variants including: AUFS, btrfs, vfs, and DeviceMapper.</p>
</div>
<div id="container-format" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Container format</h1>
<p>Docker Engine combines these components into a wrapper we call a container format. The default container format is called libcontainer. In the future, Docker may support other container formats, for example, by integrating with BSD Jails or Solaris Zones.</p>
